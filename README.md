# CampusPolls
Modern blockchain-based election platform designed specifically for campus elections and class representative (CR) elections. Features gasless transactions via Biconomy, intuitive Flutter mobile interface, and transparent Solidity smart contracts on Polygon PoS - making secure, verifiable campus voting accessible to everyone.

# ðŸŽ¯ Overview
